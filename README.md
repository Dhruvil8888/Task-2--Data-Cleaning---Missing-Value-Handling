# Task 2: Data Cleaning & Missing Value Handling

## 📌 Overview
This task focuses on cleaning real-world datasets by identifying and handling missing values. Using Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy, the dataset is prepared for machine learning by applying appropriate imputation techniques and removing low-quality data.

The task provides hands-on experience in one of the most critical steps of the data science pipeline — **data preprocessing**.

## 🔍 Task Objectives
- Identify missing values using `.isnull().sum()`
- Visualize missing data patterns
- Apply:
  - Mean / Median imputation for numerical columns
  - Mode imputation for categorical columns
- Remove columns with extremely high missing values
- Validate dataset after cleaning
- Compare dataset quality before and after cleaning

## 📓 Notebook Workflow
The Jupyter Notebook includes the following steps:

1. Import required libraries  
2. Load the dataset  
3. Identify missing values  
4. Visualize missing value distribution  
5. Separate numerical and categorical columns  
6. Apply appropriate imputation techniques  
7. Remove columns with excessive missing data  
8. Validate cleaned dataset  
9. Save cleaned dataset to CSV
